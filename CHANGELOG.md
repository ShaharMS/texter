2.0.0 (April 12, 2022) - Major Update!
===
I promised for every major update to have a new framework supported, and the new framework is  
### ü•Å  
### ü•Å
### ü•Å
**OpenFL!**
### **New Features:**

**TextFeildRTL - new class!**
`TextFieldRTL` is an "extention" of `TextField` that adds support for multiple things, such as **right-to-left text** and **built-in markdown visualization**.

It also adds some convenience methods & fields for working with the object, that `TextField` doesn't have.

 - added `autoAlign` property - aligns the text according to the first strongly typed character
 - added `openningDirection` (read-only) - specifies the base direction of the text
 - added `alignment` property, similar to `autoSize` but more understandable
 - added `overlay` property, you can now draw on top of the text
 - added `underlay` property, you can now draw below the text
 - added `markdownText` property - you can set this to make the text display things in markdown format
 - `caretIndex` is now an editable property
 - added `hasFocus` property for easy focus access
 - added `insertSubstring()`
 - added `getCaretIndexAtPoint()`
 - added `getCaretIndexOfMouse()`
 - RTL text input is now supported on platforms other then the web
 - the text selection's background now has a nicer & more natural look
 - extended markdown visualization support. also supports:
    - Horizontal Rules
    - Code Background
    - Strikethrough


**CharTools:**

 - added `charFromValue` map
 - added `charToValue` map
 - `fromCharArray` and `toCharArray` now use `Char`s instead of `String`s


**Markdown - new class! features:**

 - added a field that gives access to the visualizer - `visualizer`
 - added access to all markdown patterns via `Markdown.patterns`. more information in `MarkdowPatterns`
 - added `syntaxBlocks` field - you can redefine highlight pasers there.
 - added `interpret()` - a cross-platform, cross-framework markdown interpreter based on ADTs (algebric data types) from `MarkdownEffect.hx`
 - added `visualizeMarkdown` - a (soon to be) cross-framework method to display markdown visuals

**MarkdownPatterns - new class!**

`MarkdownPatterns` is a class consisting of the following markdown patterns: (more will be added in the future)

 - `hRuledTitleEReg`
 - `linkEReg`
 - `codeEReg`
 - `codeblockEReg`
 - `tildeCodeblockEReg`
 - `tabCodeblockEReg`
 - `imageEReg`
 - `listItemEReg`
 - `unorderedListItemEReg`
 - `titleEReg`
 - `hRuleEReg`
 - `astBoldEReg`
 - `boldEReg`
 - `strikeThroughEReg`
 - `italicEReg`
 - `astItalicEReg`
 - `mathEReg`
 - `parSepEReg`
 - `emojiEReg`
 - `indentEReg`

**MarkdownVisualizer - new class!**

`MarkdownVisualizer` is a class consisting of the framework-specific markdown visualization methods. For now, only supports visualization for:

 - OpenFL (via `TextField`, `TextFieldRTL`)

**MarkdownBlocks - new class!**

`MarkdownBlocks` is the class that handles the code block's syntax highlighting in markdown.
It provides a user friendly way to edit the syntax, and all syntax handlers can be redefiend with `MarkdownBlocks.parseLang = function(...)`

For now, syntax highlighting is only available (out-of-the-box) for theses languages:

 - JSON
 - Haxe
 - C#
 - C

More will be added in the future :)

**TextTools - new class!**

`TextTools` is a class containing static methods for manipulating text. it contains:

 - `replaceFirst()` - replaces the first occurrence of a substring inside a string
 - `replaceFirst()` - replaces the last occurrence of a substring inside a string
 - `filter()` - filters a string according to the `EReg` or `String` supplied
 - `multiply()` - multiplies a string by `X` times
 - `indexesOf()` finds and reports all occurrences of a substring inside a string
 - `indexesFromArray()` finds and reports all occurrences of the supplied substrings inside a string
 - `indexesFromEReg()` finds and reports all occurences of the findings of a regex pattern in a string.
 
**Emoji - new class!**

the `Emoji` class is pretty simple, yet powerful. it has mapping for very single emoji that github support:

 - :joy: turns into üòÇ
 - :flushed: turns into üò≥


etc.

I want to thank **PXShadow** for providing the map itself and making this possible
