# texter

## I'll start with a story

About 5 month ago, just a month after I started programming in haxeflixel, I wanted to make an app that needed text input, specificly of type RTL.

for about 2 months I tried to find some existing (decent) RTL support, but didnt find any that were good enough.

### It was the time I decided to take this duty upon myself - to add more support for text input (in that time - only in haxeflixel)

It might seem like I'm exaggerating, but trust me, it took me a **while** to make progress. but when I did start making (good) progress,
I figured I'm not the only person that needs those fixes, **and thats how and why I created this library.**

### Over-time, i wanted to add more things to the library

A month or so after the release of this library, i found myself needing a bunch more things - (markdown text, Char...) and this library expanded and expanded.

Today, it is no longer an RTL-support focused library, but a general-purpose text-related library. 

does this mean i abandoned the project of cross-framework RTL? Of course not - but now, the library is W A Y more useful, providing visual markdown text, cross-platform cross-framework markdown interpreter, Emojis and more to come!


### **Can I Help/Contribute?**
Of course! Any help is greatly appreciated! You can help with: 
- fixing bugs
- writing/fixing documentation
- making code more readable/simpler & shorter (don't worry, I think my code is pretty understandable ;) )
- writing code for the library
- adding projects that you think are useful 

And more that pops up in you mind!
