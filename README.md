# texter

## I'll start with a story

About 5 month ago, just a month after I started programming in haxeflixel, I wanted to make an app that needed text input, specificly of type RTL.

for about 2 months I tried to find some existing (decent) RTL support, but didnt find any that were good enough.

### It was the time I decided to take this duty upon myself - to add more support for text input (in that time - only in haxeflixel)

It might seem like I'm exaggerating, but trust me, it took me a **while** to make progress. but when I did start making (good) progress,
I figured I'm not the only person that needs those fixes, **and thats how and why I created this library.**

### **Can I Help/Contribute?**
Of course! Any help is greatly appreciated! You can help with: 
- fixing bugs
- writing/fixing documentation
- making code more readable/simpler & shorter (don't worry, I think my code is pretty understandable ;) )
- writing code for the library
- adding projects that you think are useful 

And more that pops up in you mind!

# Installation

#### to install the stable version:
```
haxelib install texter
```

#### to install the newer - but maybe unstable git version - 
```
haxelib git texter https://github.com/ShaharMS/texter.git
```

# About Copying

### You might have noticed that some files look like copies from libs like **OpenFL** or **HaxeFlixel**.
 No, i did not want to do this originally, but some core files had to be modified (because extending those classes didnt work) in order to make things work as expected. You can see I'm fully open about this, because I want those changes to appear in the actual lib's source code, but i dont have time for all of the pull request stuff. I'd be happy to recive help in that department :)
