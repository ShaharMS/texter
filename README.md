# texter



## I'll start with a story

About 5 month ago, just a month after I started programming in haxeflixel, I wanted to make an app that needed text input, specificly RTL.

for about 2 months I tried to find some existing (decent) RTL support, but didnt find any that were good enough.

### It was the time I decided to take this duty upon myself - to add more support for text input (in that time - only in haxeflixel)

It might seem like im exaggerating, but trust me, it took me a **while** to make progress. but when I did start making (good) progress,
I figured I'm not the only person that needs those fixes, **and thats how and why I created this library.**



## Roadmap

My memory is kinda trash, so i thought of making a roadmap for me and you to know whats supported and whats yet to be 
supported (I promise you i need this more then you ðŸ˜‚)

### FlxInputTextRTL

Reguar FlxInputText with extended support for:
 - All languages
 - Bi-directional text
 - Multilne (Almost!)

| Feature | Status | More Details | Targets |
|  :---:  |  :---: |     :---:    |  :---:  |
| General RTL typing for RTL languages | âœ… | not related to RTL characters - need to add RTL spacebar logic | All |
