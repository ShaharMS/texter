# Roadmap

My memory is kinda trash, so I thought of making a roadmap for me and you to know whats supported and whats yet to be 
supported (I promise you I need this more than you 😂)

 - ✅ - fully working
 - ❌ - needs implementation
 - ✅❌ - partially complete, probably works but might be wonky

| Scrolling Single-Line text    | ✅ | ✅ | doesnt expand the input, but moves the text so the caret will be visible|
| Left\Right Arrow Keys         | ✅ | ✅ | used to move the caret between letters/signs|
| Up/Down Arrow Keys            | ❌ | ✅ | used to move the caret between lines. on JS - multiline crashes the app|
